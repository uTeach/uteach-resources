- Fonts

Fonts are placed by groups. Each group should be contained in a separate directory, and have its files specifically denoting which type of typeset they are (itallic/normal/bold/etc)

- Images/Drawables

Images are divided by the place of usage. If they are images from the Home, they should be placed in 'Home' directory. If they are icons, which they appear in more than one flow, they should be inside 'Icons' directory. If they are placeholders, they should be inside 'Placeholders' directory (This means, to generify, if they are miscellaneous and appear in more than one flow, they should be grouped by their type of asset).

Images, should be separated into 'Android' and 'iOS' folders, having on each their different measure types. If the image has a unique size, theres no need to specify the Android/iOS folder.
